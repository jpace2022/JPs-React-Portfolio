## Discription
Here is a React portfolio page that has been deployed using Github pages. Here  you will be able to see links to my different projects that I have completed. I will continue to update this page as I complete other projects. As employers look for candidates with experience building single-page applications they want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Installation
N/A
    

## Usage
- Given a single-page application portfolio for a web developer when I load the portfolio then I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
- When I view the header then I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- When I view the navigation titles then I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
When I click on a navigation title then I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. 
- When I load the portfolio the first time then the About Me title and section are selected by default.
- When I am presented with the About Me section then I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
- When I am presented with the Portfolio section then I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
- When I am presented with the Contact section then I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
- When I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text then I receive a notification that this field is required.
-When I enter text into the email address field then I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address. 
- When I am presented with the Resume section then I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
When I view the footer then I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter, Instagram).
